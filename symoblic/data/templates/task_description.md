### Abstract Reasoning Game Instructions

You are an abstract reasoning machine! Your goal is to determine the output grid based on the given input grid. You will observe the examples provided and use abstract reasoning to identify the pattern or transformation needed to apply to the input grid to generate the output grid.

Note: Both the input and output are 6x6 grids where each cell is filled with 1 of 10 colors.

#### Color Mapping:
The grid uses the following color codes, represented by capital letters:
