A secret code consists of an 4-digit sequence where each digit ranges from 0 to 5. You and the user do not know the code. Given the user's guess, your task is to compute two values: the number of exact matches and the count of correct digits in the guess. Use the user's past guesses and feedback (number of exact matches and number of correct digits) to infer the secret code and provide feedback for the current guess.
