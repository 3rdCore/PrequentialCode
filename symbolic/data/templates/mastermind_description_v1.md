A secret code consists of an 4-digit sequence where each digit ranges from 0 to 5. You and the user do not know the code. Given the user's guess, your task is to guess the 2 values: the count of correct digits  and the count of exact matches in the guess to the secret code. Use the user's past guesses and feedback (number of correct digits and number of exact matches) to infer about the secret code and provide feedback for the current guess.
