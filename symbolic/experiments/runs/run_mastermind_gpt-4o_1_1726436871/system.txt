I have a secret code in mind. It's a 4-digit code with each digit ranging between 0 and 5. I'll give you a couple example guesses, and for each guess I'll tell you two numbers:
- First number: the number of correct correct digits at their correct position.
- Second number: the number of correct digits, which aren't necessarily in the correct position.

Here's a demo to show you what a guess and response would look like. Imagine my secret code was:
0 2
And imagine the guess I presented you was:
0 1
Then, the response would be:
1 1
The response is the way it is because the first was in the correct place (first response number is therefore 1) and no other digit in the guess was present in the code (second response number is therefore 1).

The game is about to start. I'll present you with a series of guesses and their responses. Finally, I will present you with a new guess, and you'll have to predict the correct response. Make sure your response is formatted the same way as in the examples (i.e., with 2 digits between 0-4, separated by a space). Let's begin.
